# Question Paper - 2

## Question 1

### 1.A.) Discuss any THREE (3) current threats of modern databases. (6 MARKS)

1. **SQL Injection:** Attackers manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access or make unauthorized changes to the database.
2. **Insider Threats:** Employees or users with legitimate access to the database may misuse their privileges, either intentionally or accidentally, causing harm.
3. **Ransomware Attacks:** Malicious software that locks the database, with attackers demand for a ransom to unlock or restore access to the data.
4. **Weak Access Controls:** Poor management of user permissions can lead to unauthorized users accessing or modifying sensitive data.
5. **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to information theft or leaks.

### 1.B.) Explain data redundancy with an example. (6 MARKS)

**Data Redundancy:**

* Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places within a database.
* This can lead to inconsistencies, as updating data in one place might not update it everywhere else.
* It also wastes storage space, making the database less efficient.

**Example:**

* Imagine a university database that stores student information.
* If a student's address is stored in both the "Students" table and the "Enrollment" table, that's data redundancy.
* If the student moves and only one table is updated with the new address, the database will have conflicting information, leading to errors.

### 1.C.) Describe any FOUR (4) functions of a database administrator. (8 MARKS)

The person responsible for the technical management, maintenance, day-to-day operation, and security of an organization's database management system is known as a Database Administrator (DBA).

Some functions of a Database Administrator are:

* **Database Installation & Configuration:** Setting up database servers and software by ensuring it meets the organization's needs.
* **Performance Monitoring and Tuning:** Ensuring the database runs efficiently and can handle the required workloads.
* **Backup and Recovery:** Planning and implementing backup strategies to protect data from loss and facilitate recovery in case of failure.
* **Security Management:** Controlling access to the database and protecting data from unauthorized access.
* **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing and resolving database-related issues.
