# Paper 1

**1.A)** Discuss any THREE (3) current issues on security in managing databases. (6 MARKS)

1. **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to information theft or leaks.
2. **SQL Injection:** Attackers manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access or make unauthorized changes to the database.
3. **Insider Threats:** Employees or users with legitimate access to the database may misuse their privileges, either intentionally or accidentally, causing harm.
4. **Weak Access Controls:** Poor management of user permissions can lead to unauthorized users accessing or modifying sensitive data.
5. **Ransomware Attacks:** Malicious software that locks the database, with attackers demand for a ransom to unlock or restore access to the data.

**1.B)** Explain THREE (3) advantages of a Database Management System (DBMS). (6 MARKS)

1. **Data Consistency:** Ensures that data remains consistent across different applications, reducing errors or unusual problems.
2. **Data Security:** Implements security measures like encryption and access controls to protect data from unauthorized access.
3. **Data Sharing:** Allows multiple users to access the database at the same time without causing conflicts, making it easier to work together.
4. **Efficient Data Management:** Improves data storage and retrieval processes, making it easier to manage large amounts of data.
5. **Backup and Recovery:** Provides automatic backup and recovery mechanisms, ensuring data is safe and can be restored in case of failures.

**1.C)** Describe THREE (3) functions of a data administrator. (6 MARKS)

1. **Database Design:** Planning the structure of the database, including tables, relationships, and data types to meet user requirements.
2. **Backup and Recovery:** Regularly backing up the database and implementing recovery plans to restore data in case of corruption or failures.
3. **User Access Control:** Managing user permissions and roles to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify certain data.
4. **Data Integrity Management:** Ensuring that the data stored in the database is accurate, consistent, and free from errors.
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring the database's performance and optimizing queries to ensure it runs efficiently.
