# Join in MySQL

A **join** in SQL is a powerful operation used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. By using joins, we can retrieve data spread across multiple tables in a relational database. Joins include **inner joins** (returning only matching rows), **outer joins** (left, right, and full join to include all rows from one or both tables, with NULLs where there is no match), **self joins** (which connect rows within the same table), and **cross joins** (which produce a combination of every row from one table with every row from another, creating a Cartesian product).
