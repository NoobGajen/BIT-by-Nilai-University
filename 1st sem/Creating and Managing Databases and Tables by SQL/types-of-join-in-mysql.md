A join in SQL is a powerful operation used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. By using joins, we can retrieve data spread across multiple tables in a relational database. Joins include:

* **Inner joins** (returning only matching rows)
* **Outer joins** (left, right, and full join to include all rows from one or both tables, with NULLs where there is no match)
* **Self joins** (which connect rows within the same table)
* **Cross joins** (which produce a combination of every row from one table with every row from another, creating a Cartesian product)



### Inner join

An **inner join** retrieves only the rows with match data in both tables. It is commonly used to get records that exist in both tables based on a related column.<img src=".gitbook/assets/Inner Join.png" alt="" data-size="original">
